% \lettersection{Why Google?}
% \lettersection{Why Me?}

I am writing to apply for the position of Machine Learning Engineer with the SoundCloud Music Discovery (Search and Recommendation) group, as advertised on LinkedIn. As a Senior Data Scientist with extensive experience in building and deploying machine learning models to solve complex business problems, I am confident in my ability to contribute to the team's mission of delivering high accuracy music recommendation at scale.

My experience in designing and executing experiments and A/B tests to evaluate the impact of new features and changes in games, as well as my passion for devising innovative problem-solving strategies, would be particularly relevant to this role. I am skilled in utilizing software engineering techniques to deliver scalable and robust solutions, and I have led and mentored teams of data scientists with varying levels of expertise to deliver impactful results.

SoundCloud's unique position as both a music-streaming service with the largest catalog of music and an artist services and distribution business is particularly exciting to me, and I am eager to leverage my skills and experience to help users find and play what they're looking for and connect directly with the artists who make it.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to SoundCloud's mission.

% Opening paragraph: State why you are writing; how you learned of the organization or position, and basic information about yourself.

I am confident that my skills and experience make me a great fit for the role.

% 2nd paragraph: Tell why you are interested in the employer or type of work the employer does (Simply stating that you are  interested does not tell why, and can sound like a form letter). Demonstrate that you know enough about the employer  or position to relate your background to the employer or position. Mention specific qualifications which make you a good  fit for the employer’s needs. (Focus on what you can do for the employer, not what the employer can do for you.) This  is an opportunity to explain in more detail relevant items in your resume. Refer to the fact that your resume is enclosed.  Mention other enclosures if such are required to apply for a position. 

% I am particularly interested in this position at Scout24 because of the company's focus on building a digital ecosystem that brings homeowners, seekers, and agents together. I am passionate about devising innovative problem-solving strategies and leveraging cutting-edge technologies to drive business success. With my expertise in utilizing software engineering techniques to deliver scalable and robust solutions, I believe I can make a significant contribution to Scout24's mission.

% Throughout my career, I have led and mentored teams of data scientists with varying levels of expertise to deliver impactful results. I have worked collaboratively with cross-functional teams, including game designers, developers, and product managers, to understand business needs and identify opportunities for AI/ML solutions. I have developed and deployed various models, from classic ML algorithms to 3D mesh generation models using state-of-the-art methods for data platform, marketplace, game studios, marketing, and other departments.
