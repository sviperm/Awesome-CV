\begin{cvletter}

% \lettersection{About Me}
% \lettersection{Why Google?}
% \lettersection{Why Me?}

% Opening paragraph: State why you are writing; how you learned of the organization or position, and basic information about yourself.

I'm applying for the Data Scientist position at {\companyname}. I came across this position on the Internet while looking for a job in Europe. I have more than 5 years of academic and business experience as a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer in the healthcare, game dev and marketing industries.
% I am a highly motivated data scientist who loves video games.

% 2nd paragraph: Tell why you are interested in the employer or type of work the employer does (Simply stating that you are  interested does not tell why, and can sound like a form letter). Demonstrate that you know enough about the employer  or position to relate your background to the employer or position. Mention specific qualifications which make you a good  fit for the employer’s needs. (Focus on what you can do for the employer, not what the employer can do for you.) This  is an opportunity to explain in more detail relevant items in your resume. Refer to the fact that your resume is enclosed.  Mention other enclosures if such are required to apply for a position. 

I am confident that I can contribute my knowledge and experiences to the success and growth of {\companyname}:

\bigskip
\begin{cvitems}
  
  \item {At SberGames, I implemented scalable machine learning models and optimization algorithms for big data in a production environment.}
  \item {I have experience designing and running randomized controlled experiments, analyzing the resulting data, and communicating results with other teams.}
  \item {I developed various models to boost studios' profit, such as a churn/retention prediction model, purchase prediction model, lifetime prediction, and more!}
  \item {I collaborated with game designers and game analysts to find the strengths and weaknesses in game design using the power of data science.}
  \item {At SberGames, I was also responsible for creating a database structure to collect telemetry on games and devices in a single format. This task required me to interact with many people from different departments and varying levels of seniority.}
  \item {Also, I created a marketing campaign payback model, which can predict how good the current campaign is and do we need to spend money on this.}
  \item {At BARS Group I succesfully engineered two NLP projects from developement to integration.}
  
\end{cvitems}
\bigskip

% 3rd paragraph: Indicate that you would like the opportunity to interview for a position or to talk with the employer to learn  more about their opportunities or hiring plans. State what you will do to follow up, such as telephone the employer within  two weeks. If you will be in the employer’s location and could offer to schedule a visit, indicate when. State that you would  be glad to provide the employer with any additional information needed. Thank the employer for her/his consideration.

I am a fully responsible person with strong leadership skills, able to work and collaborate with a dynamic team, explain scientific things easily to non-technical colleagues, and work independently. If you need more information, contact me by email.
